ðŸ‘‹ **Hey there!**

I'm a Master's graduate from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
My recent focus is on **3D generation** and **world models**. Beyond research, I love building cool projects and exploring musicâ€”I'm currently learning to play the guitar!

I'm always up for an interesting conversation, a brainstorming session, or a potential collaborationâ€”feel free to connect!
